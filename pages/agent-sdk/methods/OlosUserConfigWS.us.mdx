# OlosUserConfigWS

The OlosUserConfigWS allows requesting information about configurations from the Olos platform.

## getCampaignByUserLogin

```ts copy
import { OlosUserConfigWS } from "olosagentsdk";

const userConfigWS = new OlosUserConfigWS();
userConfigWS.getCampaignByUserLogin(
    login: string,
    loginOwner: string,
    passwordOwner: string,
    callback: (response: any) => void,
    callbackError?: (response: any) => void
);
```

## getChatSupervisorAgent

Requests the list of supervisors with whom the Agent can initiate a chat.

```
