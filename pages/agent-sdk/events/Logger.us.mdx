# Logger

The _Logger_ event is used to have a better visualization of the logs being sent or received by the SDK. For this type of event to start being triggered, it is necessary to set the third parameter of _createOlos_ to _true_.

```js copy
const jsLogger = true;

createOlos(addrs, auth, jsLogger);
```

These logs are separated into 4 different types: LOGGER, ERROR, INFO, and DEBUG.

### LOGGER

They are standard log types in the system.

### ERROR

They are error log types, used more when there is a communication error between the SDK and Olos.

### INFO

They are informative log types.

## How to listen?

```js copy
import { olosOn } from "olosagentsdk";

olosOn("logger", callback);
```
