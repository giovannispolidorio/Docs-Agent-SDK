# GetNextEventChat - About Login/Logout

There are two events that are initially triggered, LoginResponse and LogoutResponse.

LoginResponse is triggered when the agent is associated with a chat campaign. If the agent is not related to a chat campaign, this event is not triggered, triggering the LogoutResponse event with errorCode 12 or errorMessage = "Agent not found."
