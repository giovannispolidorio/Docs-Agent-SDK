# Pooling

After successful authentication, the polling process begins to check if there are actions to be taken for each agent. Polling consists of periodically calling a web service to obtain events available to the agent.

```js
GET - WsAgentEvent/GetNextEventChat?agentId=1234
```

## About GetNextEventChat return

The call can have two types of return

### (null)

When the call returns "(null)", it means there are no events pending for the agent at this time.

### Object

When the call returns an object with the structure specified below, it indicates that Olos sent an event to the agent. This object contains two important parameters: eventTypeId, which identifies the type of event returned, and eventData, which contains data related to the event.

```js
// This response example means that a LoginCampaign occurred in campaign 5.
