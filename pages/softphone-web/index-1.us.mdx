# Overall Vision

Web softphone integration allows you to incorporate telephone functionality directly into any web application via Iframe.This way, CRMs can offer calls from telephone calls natively without the need for separate installation or opening of the OLOS softphone.
This approach provides a more fluid user experience, reduces technical complexity and streamlines service processes.
