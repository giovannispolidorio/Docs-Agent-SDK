# 1. Receiving the Passcode

After authenticating in Olos, the logged-in agent will receive the event containing the passcode — a 4-digit numeric code — required for authentication in the CCM.

⚠️ **Attention**: The agent must be linked to at least one voice campaign. Otherwise, the system will send the LoginCCMFail event instead of the passcode.
Store the received passcode number for later use.
