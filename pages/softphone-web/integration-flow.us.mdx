# Integration Flow

Given that the integrator has already performed the integration with the Olos Agent SDK, the SoftphoneWeb activation process can be started with the following steps:

1. **Passcode**
2. **Obtaining the SoftphoneWeb base URL**
3. **Building the iframe's final URL**
4. **Including the iframe in the application**
5. **Listening to events and messages.**
6. **Sending Commands to the SoftphoneWeb (postMessage)**
