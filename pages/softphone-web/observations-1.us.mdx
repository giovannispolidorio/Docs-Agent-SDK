# Notes

- Commands sent via postMessage do not have a response. The application must consider that, when sending a message, the execution will be done immediately.
- We recommend implementing visual controls that reflect the desired state of the interface (for example: muted microphone icon), since SoftphoneWeb does not send execution confirmation.
