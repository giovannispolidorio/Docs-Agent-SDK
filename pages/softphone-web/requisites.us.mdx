# Requirements

To ensure that the **Softphone Web** integration works correctly, the following requirements must be met

- **HTTPS environment**
The application that will integrate the Softphone Web must run in an HTTPS environment, since access to the microphone via the browser requires a secure connection.

- **Prior integration with Olos Agent SDK**
The application must already be integrated with the **Olos Agent SDK**, which is responsible for managing events and telephony authentication.

- **Softphone.js installed and configured**
The integrator must include and correctly configure the **softphone.js** application in the environment.

- **WebApiSoftphone installed and configured**
It is also necessary that the **WebApiSoftphone** service is installed and configured.
